            Makkonen Tesfaye</a> was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario. He is the only child of Ethiopian
        immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu, who separated shortly after his birth.<br> He was brought up in
        the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother. He has an estranged relationship with his father,
        telling Rolling Stone in 2015 that <i>"I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and
            he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived â€” I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure
            he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He
            just wasn't there."</i></p>
